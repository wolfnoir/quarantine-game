//Contains map information at the center of the screen.
//The tiles in the screen will be clickable and should display various information.
//Each tile will be highlighted with a color corresponding to how many people are infected.
//At the top of the screen is a bar display the stats of the game--threat level, morale level,
//and cure progress, as well as population and other relevant information. Below that is a scrolling
//newsfeed that displays random bits of news. On the left side of the screen will be a menu
//displaying all the possible actions the player will be able to take, as well as their corresponding
//energy points. A graphic at top should update according to how many energy points the player has left
//to spend this turn. On the bottom right is a “next turn” button for the player to progress. For special
//events, a pop-up window will show up in the center of the screen. Pressing the escape key will allow the
//player to access the in-game menu.
